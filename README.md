# Fluid Line Animation

![Animation Preview](preview.gif)

## Overview

This project showcases an interactive, fluid line animation using Three.js. It's designed to explore the intersection of generative art and user interaction, providing a visually engaging experience that responds to user input.

## Features

- Smooth, organic line movements
- Real-time animation updates
- Responsive design for various screen sizes
- Customizable animation parameters

## Usage

The animation starts automatically upon loading the page. Users can interact with the animation in the following ways:

- Mouse movement: Influences the direction and speed of the lines
- Click and drag: Creates temporary distortions in the line patterns
- Scroll: Zooms in/out of the animation

## Customization

You can easily customize the animation by modifying the following parameters in `sketch.js`:

- `amountLines`: Number of lines in the animation
- `dotsPerLine`: Density of points per line
- `animationSpeed`: Overall speed of the animation

## Technology

This project uses:

- Three.js for 3D rendering
- HTML5 Canvas for efficient 2D drawing
- Vanilla JavaScript for logic and interactivity

## Contribution

We welcome contributions from the HCI and interaction design community! If you have ideas for improving the user experience or enhancing the visual appeal, please follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/AmazingFeature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some AmazingFeature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/AmazingFeature`)
5. Open a Pull Request

## Research Applications

This project can be used as a starting point for various HCI research topics, including:

- The impact of dynamic visual feedback on user engagement
- Studying user perception of organic vs. geometric animations
- Exploring the relationship between visual complexity and cognitive load
